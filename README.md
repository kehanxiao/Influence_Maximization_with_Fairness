# Approach 
With an influence maximization problem on a graph, we defines a weighted RR-Set algorithm to
achieve a effect of gap reduction while maximizing the total influence among the graph.

# Usage

```shell
$ python3 IMP.py -i <graph file path> -k <the number of seeds> -m <IC or LT> -t <termination time> 
```
